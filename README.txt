App for facial emotion recognition 

Beno√Æt Camille
Giraud Alexandra

you need to upload a file, then our neural network will give the probable emotion that this person is feeling
neutral, anger, sadness, surprise, hapiness or fear
If multiple people are on the frame, only one will get tested

Note that sometimes the app failes to recognise a face, or won't be able to process some images.
